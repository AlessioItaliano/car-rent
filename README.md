# About Website

Our website is built on the React framework for users who are looking to rent a
car. RENTAL is very simple, responsive, and fast. Every user will find exactly
what they are looking for! After all, our motto is 'A car in just one click!'.

The site consists of a home page, a catalog page and a favorites page.

rental price, and mileage. It provides comprehensive details about available
cars, including their specifications and associated costs.
